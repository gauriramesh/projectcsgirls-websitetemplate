# Project CS Girls Website Template
* This is a simple website template for a project I'm doing with a team of middle school girls to help solve an imminent social problem.

# How to View
* Download the zip using the green button on the top right that says "Clone or Download", and click download.
* Extract the files to a directory of your choice by doing right-click, Extract All.
* Right click on the index.html file in the UNZIPPED FOLDER and select "Open in Browser," or a similar command on your computer.
    * I prefer using Google Chrome, but it doesn't matter what browser you use.

# How to Edit
* You'll need a text editor of some sort. My favorite beginner friendly text editors include:
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* Other Editors to look into
    * [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (simple and easy to type in, difficult to navigate your files)
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (can be complex to navigate but full of cool features so once you've goten used to one, definitely try this!)

# Exercise
* Using style.css, change the background color of the HTML page to green or another color of your choice
* On line 12 of main.js, create a variable that contains your name in it surrounded by quotes.
    * This is called a [String in JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp)
* Using your awesome new variable, change the alert message from "Hello from JavaScript" to "Hello from [Your Name]"
* Helpful Example:
```
var name = "Gauri";
var smushedString = "My name is " + name;
alert(smushedString);
//An alert will pop up saying "My name is Gauri"

```

Happy coding!
