# Project CS Girls Website Template
*This is a simple website template for a project with teams of middle school girls to help solve an imminent social problem.

#How to Use
*Download the zip using the green button on the top right that says "Clone or Download", and click download.
*Extract the files to a directory of your choice by doing right-click, Extract All.
*Right click on the index.html file in the UNZIPPED FOLDER and select "Open in Browser," or a similar command on your computer.
**I prefer using Google Chrome, but it doesn't matter what browser you use.
